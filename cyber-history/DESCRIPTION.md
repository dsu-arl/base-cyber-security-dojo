Back in 2011, version 2.3.4 of an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server called "vsFTPd" was found to have a backdoor command execution vulnerability that allowed anyone
to obtain a root shell on the server by simply appending a ':)' (smiley face) to the end of the username when logging in. In this challenge you will exploit the
vulnerability to learn how it works. Run `/challenge/verify` to get your instructions.
