## Challenge Description
YeeBay has received a much needed update! The "funny trick" to login as admin no longer works, and they found a way to speed up some search times as well. I think everything is safe now. For sure.

## Challenge Steps
1. Start the challenge and use the "GUI Desktop Workspace" option
2. Navigate to the `/challenge` directory
3. Run `./verify` and `./victim`
4. Open the web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by typing it into the URL bar. This is the YeeBay page.
5. Open the web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5555` by typing it into the URL bar. This page can be used to simulate a random user performing a search.
6. Find a way to get the flag! There is some additional info on the "victim" page.
