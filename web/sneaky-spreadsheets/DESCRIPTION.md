## Challenge Description
XML is hard, so we made a little site to fix your syntax errors! Luckily we don't have to worry much about security since they're just silly little XML tags :)

## Notes
The code running this challenge does not have a `print_flag()` function, you'll have to use a vulnerability in the site to retrieve it yourself! The file is located at `/flag`.

Additionally, note that `nano` is installed for use as a text editor in the console.

## Challenge Steps
1. Navigate to the `/challenge` directory with the command `cd /challenge`
2. Run `./verify`
3. Open the web browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` by typing it into the URL bar
4. Retrieve the flag!
