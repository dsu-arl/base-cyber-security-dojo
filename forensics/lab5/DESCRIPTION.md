We received this memory dump from our client recently. Someone accessed his system when he was not there and he found some rather strange files being accessed. Find those files and they might be useful. I quote his exact statement,

The names were not readable. They were composed of alphabets and numbers but I wasn't able to make out what exactly it was.

Also, he noticed his most loved application that he always used crashed every time he ran it. Was it a virus?

Note-1: This challenge is composed of 2 flags.

Note-2: There was a small mistake when making this challenge. If you find any string which has the string "L4B_3_D0n3!!" in it, please change it to "L4B_5_D0n3!!" and then proceed.

Note-3: You'll get the stage 2 flag only when you have the stage 1 flag.
