What is Volatility?
Volatility is a powerful open-source memory forensics tool used to analyze RAM (random access memory) dumps from computers. RAM contains everything that's actively happening on a system — like running programs, open files, user activity, passwords, malware, and more — but it's all lost when the computer is shut down. Volatility helps us capture and investigate that information before it's gone.

What are we going to do in this Module?
In this module we are going to do 3 things:
1. Load a memory image provided to you in the enviroment
2. Use Volatility to investigate:
	a. Which Programs are running?
	b. Who was logged in?
	c. Were there any suspicious processes?
	d. Can we recover command histories, files, or passwords?
3. Learn basic memory forensic techniques that real-world investigators use in cybersecurity, incident response, and digital forensics.

You will find all of the memory images in /home/Volatility. They correspond with the Challenge names, example lab0 is going to be lab0 under the volatility folder.
