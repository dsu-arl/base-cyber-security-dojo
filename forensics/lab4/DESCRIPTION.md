My system was recently compromised. The Hacker stole a lot of information but he also deleted a very important file of mine. I have no idea on how to recover it. The only evidence we have, at this point of time is this memory dump. Please help me.

Note: This challenge is composed of only 1 flag.

The flag format for this lab is: inctf{s0me_l33t_Str1ng}
